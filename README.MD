## 📄 About

 FortiAnalyser - User CSV Formater is a software meant to properly format FortiAnalyser Web Filter logs when extracted, as they come really bad if you need to show some information in a report for a client.

## 🌟 Features

-   Formats CSV files extracted from FortiAnalyser in a readable way;
-   Generates 2 different formarted CSVs (a full list of what the user accessed and a short list with only the FQDNs, Hit counts and Web usage);
-   Fast and simple to use: just place your raw file in the "csv\raw\" folder and then run the software.

# How to use?

Download your FortiAnalyser Web Filter raw file (filtered for a single user) -> Place the raw log csv file in "csv\raw\" folder -> Execute the software -> Choose a language -> Input the client name and then Input the user name (these options are only used for the final file name, it doesn't interfere in the software functionality at all) -> Wait -> Your both formated csv files will be in the "csv\result\" folder
